# Integreate Personal Data System (iPDS) Project 
### (Previously called IAM Project)
## Goals and Objectives (Find your passion, join, help!)

| Goals | Objective | Objective | Objective |   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------| ----------|  ----------| ----------|
|Individuals collect, use, and share integrated data and credentials |Enhance Wallet/iPDS Testbed (currently off-line) and [Recorded-Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c95ESkIL5N5ASNZGza5TOg3okkfHBnUB/view)).  |Seek contributors. Align with related organizations | Expand current pilot |
|Organizations provide disparate data to individuals by mapping it to a standard ontology|Collaborate with IEEE Person Ontology, previously called  [MyOntology](https://opensource.ieee.org/myontology-group). Help them set up PURL server. |Seek vendors to help refine, extend, and pilot standard ontologies. |
  


## Use-Case Goals and Objectives
Use-Case-Goal: Learners store their standards-based Learner Records so multiple content developers can determine what they are ready to learn:  Objective: Continue with piloting to achieved sustained adoption. 

Use-Case-Goal: Mortgage ecosystem facilitated: Objective: Pilot: Borrowers gather standard mortgage data and credentials then seek bids from mortgage lenders.  

## Future Goals and Objectives (Not yet started)

Use-Case-Goal: Individuals save on insurance: Objective: Gather data models from many insurance companies, extend MyOntology, conduct trial where individual shares needed data and seeks bids.

## Recent Progress
1. The iPDS Testbed has been updated at github.com/I-AM-project and is ready for demo or piloting.   
2. Person Ontology (previously called MyOntology) (iPDS is built on this ontology):
   a. Person Ontology is an open source project under IEEE at https://opensource.ieee.org/myontology-group/myontology-project  IEEE is setting up a PURL server so developers can reference these terms and defintions and apps and find them.  
   b. Person Ontology needs piloting and feedback for iPDS to gain many piloters, so focus is on outreach for Person Ontology.
   c. Currently working with several key players in My Data Global to gain interest and set up a pilot.  After that will reach out to DIF, ToIP, W3C, Solid, YOMA, OWF, RWOT, Aries, OCA, etc. This is being done in sequence, to improve our offering and message as we go, so this could take some time.  
3. The Open Wallet Foundation (a Linux Foundation project, just like this one) Architecture Team has invited iPDS to present a demo of how the data elements comprising the claim of a Verifiable Credential can be referenced for this emerging standard ontology, plus its parent Common Core Ontology. We plan to do this demo as soon as IEEE sets up their PURL Server. 
4. It is anticipated that the above collaboration and outreach will recruit more testers and developers for the IAM-Project iPDS. This will take time, but commitment exists to take as long as needed to achieve this goal.
