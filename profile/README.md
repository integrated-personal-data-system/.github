# Goals and Objectives (Find your passion, join, help!)
'Goals' are various desired End-States.   'Objectives' are the next steps to get to each Goal. 'Primary' = Main Objective for that Goal. 'Secondary' = Another objective for that Goal.  'Supporting' = Provides value to a Primary Objective.

|  | Goal-1: Organizations achieve goals of Zero Trust | Goal-2: Individuals collect, use, and share integrated data and credentials  |Goal-3: Organizations help members govern their wallets | Goal-4: Organizations share their unique data by mapping it to a standard  | Goal-5: Organizations implement Identity Lifecycle Management (ILM)|
| ----------------------------- | -------------| ----------|  ----------| ----------| ----------|

Use-Case-Goal: Freelancers and clients match and interact via P2P (no platform): Objective-8: Recruit volunteer freelancers to help pursue Goal-2 (for this use case).

Use-Case-Goal: Individuals save on insurance: Objective-9: Gather data models from many insurance companies, extend MyOntology, conduct trial where individual shares needed data and seeks bids.

Use-Case-Goal: Home Mortgage ecosystem facilitated: Objective-11: Pilot: Borrows gather standard mortgage data and credentials, and seek bids from mortgage lenders.  

Use-Case-Goal: Pharmacy Operations improve cyber security: Objective 12: Create Minimum Viable Product, Risk Assessment, and obtain authority to operate an initial pilot, then build toward robust solution.
