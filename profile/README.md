| Goals | Objective | Objective | Objective |   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------| ----------|  ----------| ----------|
|Individuals collect, use, and share integrated data and credentials |Enhance Wallet/iPDS [Testbed](https://iamtestingbed.com/) and [Recorded-Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nj4byZTrHKp8ENU6BmRcNlhOXcFvFWFu/view).  [Tasks](https://github.com/I-AM-project/tasks-for-volunteers/tree/main/Aries-Personal-Data-Store)|Seek contributors. Align with related organizations | Expand current pilot |
|Organizations provide disparate data to individuals by mapping it to a standard ontology|Collaborate with IEEE [MyOntology](https://opensource.ieee.org/myontology-group) Project. Help them set up PURL server. |Seek vendors to help refine, extend, and pilot standard ontologies. |
|Organizations achieve goals of Zero Trust |Pilot orgs set up Didymium or other networks, assesses risk, gain approvals, and pilot.  [Repo](https://github.com/I-AM-project/bbu-gf) | Demo how identity/iPDS Wallet helps organizations acheive Zero Trust |

   


## Use-Case Goals and Objectives
Use-Case-Goal: Learners store their standards-based Learner Records so multiple content developers can determine what they are ready to learn:  Objective: Continue with piloting to achieved sustained adoption. 

Use-Case-Goal: Mortgage ecosystem facilitated: Objective: Pilot: Borrows gather standard mortgage data and credentials, and seek bids from mortgage lenders.  

Use-Case-Goal: Pharmacy Operations improve cyber security: Objective: Create Minimum Viable Product, Risk Assessment, and obtain authority to operate an initial pilot, then build toward robust solution. 

## Future Goals and Objectives (Not yet started)

Goal: Organizations implement Identity Lifecycle Management (ILM).  Objective: Orgs develop ILM, assess risk, and pilot

Goal: Organizations help members govern their wallets

Use-Case-Goal: Freelancers and clients match and interact via P2P (no platform): Objective: Recruit volunteer freelancers to help develop and pilot

Use-Case-Goal: Individuals save on insurance: Objective: Gather data models from many insurance companies, extend MyOntology, conduct trial where individual shares needed data and seeks bids.

## Recent Progress
1. The iPDS Testbed has been updated at github.com/I-AM-project and is ready for demo or piloting. It will be the core of a My Data Global tech demo (mid-Nov).  
2. MyOntology (iPDS is build on IEEE MyOntology):
   a. MyOntology is an open source project under IEEE at https://opensource.ieee.org/myontology-group/myontology-project  It will soon have a PURL server to enable developers to link to permanent terms in the ontology. 
   b. MyOntology needs piloting and feedback for iPDS to gain many piloters, so focus is on outreach for MyOntology.
   c. Currently working with several key players in My Data Global to gain interest and set up a pilot.  After that will reach out to DIF, ToIP, W3C, Solid, YOMA, OWF, RWOT, Aries, OCA, etc. This is being done in sequence, to refine the offering message, so this could take some time.  
3. It is anticipated that the above collaboration and outreach will recruit more testers and developers for the IAM-Project iPDS. This will take time, but commitment exists to take as long as needed to achieve this goal. 

## Next meeting will be scheduled upon request of any member
