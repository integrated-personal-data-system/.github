# Goals and Objectives (Find your passion, join, help!)
Goal: Individuals collect, use, and share integrated data and credentials  Objective: Wallet with iPDS: Enhance [Testbed](https://iamtestingbed.com/).  [  Tasks](https://github.com/I-AM-project/tasks-for-volunteers/tree/main/Aries-Personal-Data-Store)

Goal: Organizations share their unique data by mapping it to a standard.   Objective-3: Collaborate with IEEE MyOntology: Seek vendors to help refine, extend, and pilot.  [Repo](https://opensource.ieee.org/myontology-group) 

Goal: Organizations achieve goals of Zero Trust.  Objective-1: Orgs set up a Didymium or other networks, assess risk, seek approvals, and pilot.  [Repo](https://github.com/I-AM-project/bbu-gf)


'Goals' are various desired End-States.   'Objectives' are the next steps to get to each Goal. 'Primary' = Main Objective for that Goal. 'Secondary' = Another objective for that Goal.  'Supporting' = Provides value to a Primary Objective.

## Use-Case Goals and Objectives
Use-Case-Goal: Learners store their standards-based Learner Records so multiple content developers can determine what they are ready to learn:  Objective: Continue with piloting to achieved sustained adoption. 

Use-Case-Goal: Mortgage ecosystem facilitated: Objective: Pilot: Borrows gather standard mortgage data and credentials, and seek bids from mortgage lenders.  

Use-Case-Goal: Pharmacy Operations improve cyber security: Objective: Create Minimum Viable Product, Risk Assessment, and obtain authority to operate an initial pilot, then build toward robust solution. 

## Future Goals and Objectives (Not yet started)

Goal: Organizations implement Identity Lifecycle Management (ILM).  Objective: Orgs develop ILM, assess risk, and pilot

Goal: Organizations help members govern their wallets

Use-Case-Goal: Freelancers and clients match and interact via P2P (no platform): Objective: Recruit volunteer freelancers to help develop and pilot

Use-Case-Goal: Individuals save on insurance: Objective: Gather data models from many insurance companies, extend MyOntology, conduct trial where individual shares needed data and seeks bids.
