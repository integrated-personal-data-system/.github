## Use-Case Goals and Objectives
Use-Case-Goal: Learners store their standards-based Learner Records so multiple content developers can determine what they are ready to learn:  Objective: Continue with piloting to achieved sustained adoption. 

Use-Case-Goal: Mortgage ecosystem facilitated: Objective: Pilot: Borrows gather standard mortgage data and credentials, and seek bids from mortgage lenders.  

Use-Case-Goal: Pharmacy Operations improve cyber security: Objective: Create Minimum Viable Product, Risk Assessment, and obtain authority to operate an initial pilot, then build toward robust solution.

Goal: Organizations implement Identity Lifecycle Management (ILM).  Objective: Orgs develop ILM, assess risk, and pilot

Goal: Organizations help members govern their wallets

Use-Case-Goal: Freelancers and clients match and interact via P2P (no platform): Objective: Recruit volunteer freelancers to help develop and pilot

Use-Case-Goal: Individuals save on insurance: Objective: Gather data models from many insurance companies, extend MyOntology, conduct trial where individual shares needed data and seeks bids.
