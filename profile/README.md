# Integreate Personal Data System (iPDS) Project 
### (Previously called IAM Project)(Short link to this site https://bit.ly/4c47gTR)
## Goals and Objectives (Find your passion, join, help!)

| Goals | Objective | Objective | Objective |   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------| ----------|  ----------| ----------|
|Individuals collect, integrate, use, and share integrated data and credentials |Enhance iPDS Testbed, currently off-line, but see [Recorded-Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c95ESkIL5N5ASNZGza5TOg3okkfHBnUB/view)).  |Become component of Open Wallet Foundation |Seek contributors to write code, test, demo. Seek initial user group |
|Organizations provide disparate data to individuals by mapping it to a standard ontology and transforming instance data|Collaborate with [IEEE P3195.1.2 Person Ontology Project](https://opensource.ieee.org/person-ontology-group/person-ontology-project) Set up IEEE PURL server. |Seek vendors to map and transform their data. |

## IEEE P3195.1.2 Person Ontology
This standards project is developing a standard ontology that our iPDS data store will conform with. 
  
## Open Wallet Foundation Interest
This project has an open invitation to demo this capability to technical committees of the Open Wallet Foundation, where the leaders agree a universal wallet also needs to be a Personal Data System (PDS). We are awaiting release of the IEEE PURL Server, a first draft of IEEE P3195.1.2 Person Ontology, and updates to our tech demo (please help if you can). 

## My Data Global 
My Data Global at Mydata.org has a proposed Thematic Group with members from 18 organizations who are working to develop a 'Standard Personal Data Model.'   This iPDS project will develop open source code that implement their model and fulfills their commitment of placing the individual at the center of a new ecosystem.
